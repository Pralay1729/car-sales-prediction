# car-sales-prediction
This project aims to predict car sales using historical data and machine learning techniques. The core predictive model is built using Linear Regression to estimate sales figures based on various car attributes and market factors. The solution is deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the model in real time.
